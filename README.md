# Geohackweek Tutorial Contents Repository

This repository contains most of the content for the geohackweek tutorials.

See the [geohackweek wiki](https://github.com/geohackweek/ghw2017/wiki/Running-Jupyter-Notebooks-Locally) for instructions on running these tutorials.

Unfortunately some notebooks won't run as is, because they use large data files that are not available on this repository, they connect to a PostGIS database that for security is not reachable outside UW domains (such as the [Vector Tools tutorial](https://geohackweek.github.io/vector/)), or other technical reasons like that. But you can still go over the code and outputs in the notebooks, and if you're really interested you can contact the author directly.
